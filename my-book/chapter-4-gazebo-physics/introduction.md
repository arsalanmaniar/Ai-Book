# Introduction to Gazebo Physics Simulation

**Module**: Module 2 "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)"
**Chapter**: 4 - Physics Simulation in Gazebo
**Created**: 2025-12-20
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-20

## Overview

Welcome to Chapter 4: Physics Simulation in Gazebo! This chapter forms the foundation of the Digital Twin module, focusing on creating realistic simulated environments for humanoid robots. You'll learn how to model physical properties, simulate gravity and collisions, and create accurate representations of real-world physics in virtual environments.

Physics simulation is crucial for robotics development because it allows us to test algorithms, validate robot designs, and train AI systems in a safe, controlled, and cost-effective environment before deploying on real robots.
