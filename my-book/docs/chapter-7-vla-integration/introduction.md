# Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

This chapter introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems that integrate Large Language Models with robotics, enabling natural human-robot interaction through vision, language, and action capabilities.

## Learning Goals

After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
- Understand the fundamentals of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems
- Explain how LLMs can be integrated with robotic systems
- Design basic vision-language-action pipelines
- Map high-level language commands to robotic actions

## Practical Focus

This chapter emphasizes hands-on experience with:
- Setting up LLM-robotics interfaces
- Building voice-to-action pipelines
- Implementing cognitive planning for robotic tasks
